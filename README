*** The JavaScript library ***

This is a library of JS functions that are designed to make life easier. Most
of the functions are there because 1) they were mistakenly not included in the
language, or 2) they are there to correct a design defect in the language.

So far they are taken entirely from the collected publications of Douglas
Crockford.
